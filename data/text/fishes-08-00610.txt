Abstract: Grouper aquaculture is a rapidly growing and dynamic industry within the Taiwan
aquaculture sector that serves as an important source of income generation. Farming ﬁshes at a
better location (FFABL) is a promising production strategy. This study evaluated the production and
economic performance of grouper farming in Taiwan. This investigation employed two steps: (1) a
cost–beneﬁt analysis to determine the main component affecting proﬁtability; and (2) multivariate
statistics to clarify the relationship between biological and economic factors. The ﬁndings suggest
that the best choice of species is hybrid giant grouper that generates and highlights a positive income,
viable beneﬁt–cost ratio and proﬁt rate. The study found the feed management of hybrid giant
groupers requires more consideration due to its low feed conversion ratio. The producers need to
replace trash ﬁsh in commercial feed during the production cycle to ensure better feed management.
Finally, this paper argues that feed is the main constraint for grouper farming, which is sensitive to
any change in feed productivity, and this constraint must be solved to sustain the grouper industry
in Taiwan.

Key Contribution: Regarding grouper aquaculture in Taiwan, this study reveals the signiﬁcant
impact of location, species and management factors on biological, economic and proﬁtability variables.
It provides recommendations to enhance economic beneﬁts and sustainability.

1. Introduction

The aquaculture of groupers is carried out in tropical and subtropical areas throughout
the world, but most production occurs in Asia. Three countries are responsible for an
estimated 93% of global production, including China (65% of total production), Taiwan
(17%) and Indonesia (11%) [1]. FAO reported that almost 155,000 tons of grouper were
produced in 2015, with a total value of USD 630 million [2]. Grouper farming has been
expanding in Taiwan, with the land area used for grouper farming increasing from 1235 ha
in 2003 to 2336 ha in 2017 [3]. Consequently, grouper has emerged as one of the primary
and most economically valuable species in aquaculture [4].

The application of genetics is an established approach to improving farming efﬁciency
which has been widely applied and is increasingly used in aquaculture [5]. However,
there have been studies exploring the hybridization of groupers, such as E. fuscoguttatus
× E. polyphekadion [6], E. costae × E. marginatus [7], E. fuscoguttatus × E. lanceolatus [8] and
E. coioides × E. lanceolatus [9]. The main appeal of hybrid groupers is increasing harvesta-
bility and environmental tolerance [10], as well as improving their growth rates [11].

Farming ﬁshes at a better location (FFABL) is a promising production strategy which
involves assessing the environmental and economic suitability of farming areas for the
cultivation of major species. In terms of economic evaluation, production costs are one
of the major factors affecting proﬁtability, and the costs of fry, feed and labor are the
most signiﬁcant expenditures in ﬁsh farming [12–15]. Moreover, the production scale of
cultivation farms can inﬂuence the input and output of the production process [16–18].
Different cultured species also can inﬂuence the variation in production costs, and in
turn reﬂect the differences in proﬁt performance. Efﬁcient management is necessary to
maximize farming proﬁt, and analysis of the cost–return structure can, therefore, identify
areas needing improvement for the cost-efﬁcient management of farming [19].

Bio-economic analysis can provide insight into how to achieve better farming man-
agement strategies [20], which quantiﬁes the economic implications of any change in the
parameters of production and markets [21]. In this study, cost–beneﬁt analysis was applied
to evaluate farm proﬁtability [22–27]. Multivariate analysis methods, including Maha-
lanobis distance and canonical discriminant function, were applied to assess variables
identiﬁed as highly correlated with farm performance [15,18]. These results could provide
a quantitative technique to assist producers in understanding and interpreting the many
interrelated processes in grouper culture and the economic constraints faced by produc-
ers. Building upon this as a theoretical foundation, we conducted research towards the
advancement of the objective of FFABL.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Data Input and Study Site

Two types of grouper species (green grouper and hybrid giant grouper) were evaluated
in two locations (Kaohsiung and Pingtung) (Figure 1). A survey, through interviews with
four-category growers, was conducted from July 2016 to March 2017. In 2017, there were a
total of 1282 grouper aquaculture operators, with 382 in Kaohsiung and 467 in Pingtung.
For this study, a sample of 61 operators was interviewed, comprising 29 from Kaohsiung
and 32 from Pingtung.

2.2. Economic Analysis
2.2.1. Cost–Beneﬁt Analysis

In cost–beneﬁt analysis, the costs consist of operating expenses and depreciation
costs [19,29]. Operating expenses refer to the expenses incurred in aquaculture, such as fry,
water–electricity, personnel, feed, management and marketing, excluding initial investment,
while depreciation costs refer to the annual amortized cost calculated by the straight-line

depreciation method based on the purchase cost of hardware equipment, such as paddle
wheels and water pumps. The unit is one thousand New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) per fen,
with one US dollar equal to NTD 30.2. One hectare is equal to 10.31 fen (1 fen = 967 m2).

In cost–beneﬁt analysis, cost inputs and proﬁts are deﬁned and calculated as follows:

(1) Cost variables (NTD/year): costi/unit area (fen)

i.

Fry cost (FC), feed cost (FDC), labor cost (LC), water–electricity cost (WEC)
and other cost (OC)

(2) Total return (TR) (NTD/year): stocking density (piece/fen) × survival rate (%) ×

harvest size (kg/piece) × purchasing price (NTD/kg)

(3) Total cost (TC)(NTD/year): fry cost + feed cost + personnel cost + water–electricity

cost + other costs (NTD/year)

(4) Net return (NR) (NTD/year): total earning (NTD/year)-total cost (NTD/year)
(5) Beneﬁt–cost ratio (BCR): BCRn = NRn/TCn

n: the nth year
BCRn: Beneﬁt–cost ratio in the nth year

(6) Proﬁt rate (PR): PRn = NRn/TRn

PRn: Proﬁt rate in the nth year

2.2.2. Multivariate Analysis

The effects of geographical location and species on proﬁtability performance were
examined by multivariate analyses. We conducted a test of the null hypothesis that the
main effect means (expressed in mean vectors) caused by the factor of geographical location
would not be statistically different. The test was as follows: H0: uL = uS, where ‘uL’ refers
to the location factor and ‘uS’ refers to the species factor. This analysis was applied to three
key variables: biological variables, input intensities and proﬁtability variables, including
a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) that considered the studied factors of location,
species and the interaction between these groups. Subsequently, a two-way ANOVA was
employed to further analyze variables that exhibited signiﬁcant differences, exploring the
speciﬁc factors inﬂuencing these variables.

Mahalanobis Distances and Canonical Discriminant Function

The Mahalanobis distances among the four categories were ﬁrst calculated using
biological variables, input intensities and proﬁtability variables, respectively, to validate
the differences in farming performance [30]. These were calculated as follows.

ij = (cid:0)xi − xj
D2

(cid:1)(cid:48)

C−1(cid:0)xi − xj

(cid:1),

where D2
ij is the Mahalanobis distance between category i and category j, xi is a mean
vector of the ith category with dimensions of 4 × 1 and C−1 is a unique inverse of variance–
covariance matrix C with dimensions of 4 × 4.

The canonical discriminant function was used to ﬁnd linear combinations of the
quantitative variables providing maximal separation among the locations and species. The
ﬁrst few functions were expected to be sufﬁcient to account for almost all of the important
group differences, and the canonical discriminant functions were sufﬁcient to account for
almost all of the important differences in farms [31]. This was calculated as follows.

CANi = α1X1 + α2X2 + α3X3 + · · · + αnXn,

Fishes 2023, 8, 610

where Xn indicates fry cost, feed cost, labor cost, water–electricity cost and other cost as
input intensity variables, and mean total revenue, net revenue, beneﬁt cost ratio and proﬁt
rate as proﬁtability variables.

Cobb-Douglas Production Function

The Cobb–Douglas production function was used to study the quantitative relation-
ship between the inputs and output of the production system. Carefully evaluating this
quantitative relationship helped to measure the responsiveness of the output to a unit
increase in the inputs. The production function would exhibit increasing returns to scale if
ε > 1; i.e., a simultaneous increase in all inputs by a certain percentage would result in a
greater percentage increase in the output. If ε = 1, the production function would exhibit
constant returns to scale; i.e., a simultaneous increase in all inputs by a certain percentage
would result in an increase in production by the same percentage. If ε < 1, the production
function would exhibit decreasing returns to scale; i.e., the proportional increase in the
output would be less than the proportional increase in all inputs [23]. Computer software
developed by the SAS Institute was adopted for this analysis.

3. Results

Table 1 summarizes the basic statistical data related to biological and economic vari-
ables, distinguished by location (Kaohsiung and Pingtung) and species (hybrid giant
grouper and green grouper) of grouper aquaculture in Taiwan. The means and standard
deviations of the original biological variables, input intensities and proﬁtability variables in
the four farming categories are listed in Table 2. Notably, our focus in Tables 1 and 2 centers
on survival rates and feed costs derived from data gathered during on-site interviews with
aquaculture farmers, capturing essential information regarding various variables.

A two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated that the studied
factors of location and species had signiﬁcant effects on the biological variables, input
intensities and proﬁtability variables, and their interactions had signiﬁcant effects on
proﬁtability variables (Table 3). The results demonstrated that the location had a statistically
signiﬁcant effect on the stocking density (p < 0.0001) and farming cycle (p = 0.0068), and the
species also had a signiﬁcant effect on the farming cycle (p = 0.0001) (Table 4). The results
showed that the location had statistically signiﬁcant effect on the fry cost, feed cost and
total cost (p < 0.0001) (Table 5). Furthermore, the species had a statistically signiﬁcant effect
on the proﬁtability variables (p < 0.0001), and the location had signiﬁcant effects on the
total and net revenue (Table 6).

The Mahalanobis distances which computed the input intensity variables highlighted
signiﬁcant differences in the management performances among the four categories (Table 7).
Nevertheless, the distances computed using proﬁtability variables all showed signiﬁcant
differences across locations and species (Table 8).

1 Mahalanobis distance was expressed considering proﬁtability variables, including total revenue, net revenue,
beneﬁt–cost ratio and proﬁt rate as a whole. 2 The values in the table represent Mahalanobis distances, providing
a measure of the distance between each data point and the group mean. 3 The values represent the p-values of
Mahalanobis distances, indicating the statistical signiﬁcance of the distance between each data point and the
group mean.

Canonical discriminant function analysis was performed by considering the input
intensities and proﬁtability variables across locations and species (Table 9). The canonical
variables were as follows:

CAN1 = 0.1028FC + 0.6771FDC + 0.3771WEC + 0.3881LC + 0.1028OC

CAN2 = −1.0622FC + 0.3165FDC + 0.5013WEC + 0.2217LC − 1.0622OC

Figure 3 shows the distribution of grouper farms according to locations and species

through proﬁtability variables.

Using the Cobb–Douglas function, various methods (i.e., forward selection, backward
elimination, stepwise, adjusted R2 selection and Mallows’ Cp selection) were analyzed at
the same time to estimate the relationship between total production (TP) and the ﬁve cost
inputs, including fry (FC), feed (FDC), water–electricity (WEC), labor (LC) and other costs
(OC). This method showed that only the feed cost had signiﬁcant effects (p < 0.0001) on the
total production of green grouper and hybrid grouper, with elasticities of 1.0156 and 0.9045,
respectively (Tables 11 and 12). The equations used for green and hybrid giant grouper
were TP = 8.4735 × 10−3 × FDC1.0156 and TP = 1.1815 × 10−3 × FDC0.9045, respectively.

4. Discussion

This study demonstrates that producers in Pingtung have stock of either green or
hybrid giant grouper of over 10,000 pcs/fen compared to producers in Kaohsiung, which
are stocked at 5000 pcs/fen. The survival rate, apart from that of hybrid giant grouper in
Kaohsiung, is below 65% (Table 2). Similarly to other studies, it was found that groupers
are carnivorous ﬁsh; most of the mortality occurs within the ﬁrst month after stocking, with
a survival rate below 75% [12]. In this study, we found that the farmers stocked 5–6 cm of
fry of both species. Selection of the appropriate fry size in grouper culture is extremely
crucial, and increasing the fry size improves the survival rate of both species. The preferred
fry size for stocking is above 7 cm, given that grouper fry are highly cannibalistic [32].
From an economic standpoint, a better survival rate would increase farming production
and therefore increase revenue. However, a small fry size increases their susceptibility
to environmental ﬂuctuations, and this vulnerability intensiﬁes during the transition of
grouper fry from the nursery to net cages for their grow-out phase, particularly within
the ﬁrst week. The increased risk of diseases at this stage is attributed to various stressors,
including handling, sorting, transportation, packing, stocking density, and the health status
of fry during the nursery or captive stages [33]. Furthermore, the effect of the farming
cycle from an economic perspective is signiﬁcant in the farming business. The farming
cycle for hybrid giant grouper farming in both locations is between 11 and 13 months, but
this takes 16 to 17 months for green grouper. Longer production periods in ﬁsh culture
normally cause increasing costs, while shorter cycles lead to economic proﬁts [20]. Finally,
the ﬁndings of the present study demonstrate that a better fry quality will improve the
survival rate, and that the hybrid giant grouper is the best choice of species due to its
shorter farming cycle.

In this study, the cost variables, including fry, feed, labor, water–electricity and others,
were measured. Feed cost was found to be the largest expense for commercial grouper
farming, ranging from 57% to 61% over locations and species (Tables 1 and 2). This ﬁnding
resonates with established assertions that highlight feed costs constituting 30% to 60% of the
total production costs in tilapia farming [34]. Moreover, a parallel scenario was observed in
Taiwan, where feed costs represent the dominant proportion in the total production costs
of Eleutheronema tetradactylum cultivation [35]. In a similar vein, bioeconomic studies on
hybrid grouper farming in Vietnam have revealed that feed costs account for 68% to 74%
of the total costs [36]. Commercial feed is the primary feed source for green grouper, and
producers apply reasonable feed management in the range of 1.5 to 2.0 for the current feed
conversion ratio. It is inferred that green grouper producers have strict control over feed
management. On the other hand, the feed conversion ratio (FCR) for hybrid giant grouper
of 3.0 to 6.0 as trash ﬁsh represents the most common source of feed. FCR was calculated
as the ratio of the feed weight provided over a certain period to the corresponding increase
in body weight. A lower FCR indicated more efﬁcient feed utilization. According to the
research reports, an FCR of 3.6 was obtained for 1.2 kg of harvested ﬁsh, and the FCR range
for grouper cage cultures was between 6 and 17 [1,37,38]. The FCR when using low-value
ﬁnﬁsh ranged from 9 to 12 for grouper farming in Vietnam [36].

Fry constitutes the second major expense for the grouper farming business. The unit
price of green grouper and hybrid giant grouper range from NTD 12 to 26 and from NTD 13
to 35 per fry, respectively. The cost difference across species results from different degrees
of success in hatching. The survival of groupers in hatchery systems is generally very
low when compared to other ﬁnﬁsh [39,40]. Moreover, high mortality during the early
larval stages has been observed in most grouper species reared in hatcheries [7,41–44]. The
limited availability of hybrid ﬁngerlings is a major constraint on the grouper aquaculture
industry, as larval mortality rates are high and seed cost is high. The high seed costs are a
result of the limited number of grouper hybrid eggs [36]. Therefore, giant hybrid producers
must consider using commercial feed in the future to improve feed management, as well as
stocking fry of the proper size to compensate for the expensive fry price.

The proﬁt indices representing business performance analyzed in this study included
total revenue, net revenue and BCR. The evidence obtained from grouper cultures proved
that the hybrid giant grouper retained a high BCR (1.88–1.91) and PR (0.43–0.45). These
indices are almost similar to the BCR index of a humpback grouper culture in Indonesia [12].
This performance of the proﬁtability index was mainly related to the sales price. Since the
hybrid giant grouper’s sales price was higher than green grouper, therefore, the hybrid
giant grouper had higher BCR and PR values. Finally, this study reveals that hybrid giant
grouper is the ﬁrst choice of species due to its strong market demand, sales prices, fast
growth rate and shorter production cycle compared to green grouper.

Mahalanobis distance and the canonical discriminant function were applied to measure
distances, which were computed using input intensities and proﬁtability variables. These
analyses revealed that the fry and feed costs are the main expenses in hybrid giant grouper
cultures, as shown in Figure 2. The ﬁgure demonstrated that hybrid giant grouper farms
are distributed at higher CAN1 (positive sign) and higher CAN2 (negative sign) scores,
indicating that these farms spend more on fry and feed costs. Figure 3 shows that hybrid
giant grouper farms had higher CAN4 and CAN5 scores. This indicates that hybrid giant
grouper cultures retain better BCR and PR indices. These results support the evidence
mentioned previously that hybrid giant grouper exhibits a better economic performance.
Cobb–Douglas function analysis revealed that the key variable inﬂuencing production
was strongly determined by the feed cost. The analysis revealed that the green grouper unit
return decreases by 1% if the feed component increases by 1.0156%. It could be said that
the proﬁt generated from production decreases if producers cannot properly manage the
feeding protocol during the production cycle. A similar trend was highlighted in hybrid
giant grouper farming: the unit decreases when feed expenses are increased. These results
reveal that feed is the main constraint on Taiwan grouper farming and is very sensitive
to any change in productivity. An increase in FCR would positively increase the cost of
producing a kilogram of grouper [45]. Inefﬁcient use of trash ﬁsh causes grouper producers
to have less control over feeding management [12]. As a result, the feed management of
both grouper species allow aquaculture to improve in the future in order to sustain the
grouper industry in Taiwan.

5. Conclusions

The results of this study indicate that location, species and management factors have
signiﬁcant impacts on the biological, economic and proﬁtability variables in grouper
aquaculture. To enhance the economic viability and sustainability of grouper farming, it is
recommended to improve feed management, select appropriate fry sizes for stocking and
emphasize cost control and production cycles.

Furthermore, the ﬁndings highlight that feed is a critical limiting factor for both green
and hybrid giant grouper species, and its productivity is highly sensitive to any changes.
Therefore, implementing feeding protocols and transitioning from trash ﬁsh to commercial
feed are crucial steps toward better feed management.

Moreover, this study reveals that hybrid giant grouper farming demonstrates a
more positive income, a viable beneﬁt–cost ratio and superior proﬁt rates. Thus, when
considering the choice of species for aquaculture, the hybrid giant grouper stands out
due to its strong market demand, higher selling prices, faster growth rate and shorter
production cycle.

In summary, this study emphasizes the inﬂuence of location, species and management
factors on various aspects of grouper aquaculture, including biological, economic and
proﬁtability variables. Improving feed management, selecting appropriate fry sizes and
focusing on cost control and production cycles will contribute to enhancing the economic
beneﬁts and sustainability of grouper farming in the future.

As the present study focuses on the analysis of the grouper aquaculture industry in
Taiwan based on data collected from 2016 to 2017, the limitations may include the inﬂuence
of temporal and spatial factors. In the future, we plan to combine recent survey data with

information on other signiﬁcant aquaculture species, integrating data from previous years
to explore strategies for FFABL.
