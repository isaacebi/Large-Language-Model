Title: Recent Advances in AI Applications for Hybrid Grouper Aquaculture

Abstract: This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in AI applications for hybrid grouper aquaculture. Through a systematic analysis of diverse research papers published between 2020 and 2024, the review aims to synthesize the current state of knowledge on AI integration in aquaculture and identify emerging themes for future research.

1. Introduction: The introduction outlines the objective of analyzing selected papers to extract insights on AI technologies' role in enhancing hybrid grouper farming efficiency and sustainability. It details the steps of extracting data from selected papers, synthesizing information to identify common themes and trends, and discussing key findings related to AI applications in aquaculture.
   
2. Methodology: The methodology involves searching relevant academic sources such as Semantic Scholar and DuckDuckGo for recent publications on AI and aquaculture hybrid grouper. We will carefully analyze the results to identify common themes, trends, and key findings related to AI applications in aquaculture, specifically focusing on hybrid grouper farming.
   
3. Results: After conducting our search and analysis, we found that AI is proving to be a valuable tool for optimizing fish farming practices. Researchers are using AI-based systems to predict optimal growth conditions and detect diseases early, reducing the risk of infection and loss. Additionally, AI is being used to analyze environmental factors like water temperature and quality, helping farmers make more informed decisions about their aquaculture operations.
   
4. Discussion: The discussion outlines the potential benefits of AI integration in hybrid grouper aquaculture, including improved productivity, reduced costs, and enhanced sustainability. We identify key challenges to adoption, such as data availability and quality, as well as a lack of standardized protocols for AI implementation in aquaculture.
   
5. Conclusion: In conclusion, the potential benefits of AI integration in hybrid grouper aquaculture are significant, but several challenges must be addressed before widespread adoption can occur. Researchers should focus on developing standardized protocols and addressing data quality issues to ensure that AI technologies contribute to a more sustainable future for aquaculture practices.
